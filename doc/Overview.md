## About

This smart contract is a multi-signature vault that allows the management of a shared account by a group of signers. The contract ensures that no single user has complete control over the account, and transactions can only be executed when a predetermined number of signers approve the transaction. Once at least signer limit of signers confirmed, any signer can execute transaction.

## Features

- Connect to other contracts: Allows connecting to other contracts by providing a valid contract address.

- Set signer limit: Allows the owner to set the minimum number of signers required to execute a transaction.

- Add a new transaction: Allows signers to add new transactions that require approval.

- Sign/Reject transaction: Allows signers to sign or reject a transaction added by another signer.

- Execute transaction: Executes the transaction if the minimum number of signatures is met.

## Usecases

The multi-signature vault is commonly used in dApps, where funds are stored in a shared account managed by a group of users. This type of contract provides an additional layer of security for users by requiring multiple signatures for executing transactions.
